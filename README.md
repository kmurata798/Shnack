# SHNACK
## Description:
I will create an app that gives users the ability to click a button and generate a meal that they can choose to eat
for breakfast/lunch/dinner. The app would be useful for those who have a hard time deciding on what they want to eat
for a given day at a given time. Whether its someones lunch break or a bigger group meal, the users would be able to randomly generate meals until they have found one that seems fit!

When in doubt, go to SHNACK!

# FUNCTIONALITY:
Upon visiting the Shnack website, users will be directed to the Shnack Welcome Page.
The Welcome Page is where the user will be greeted and provided the option to generate a random meal by clicking the button near the center of the page. 

When the user clicks on the blue button, "Get a Meal," the user will be directed to a new page populated with:
  - a random meal name
  - a picture of the random meal
  - ingredients to replicate the meal

If the user decides that he/she wants to choose a different meal, then the user can press the blue "Get a Meal" button to generate another random meal.

The user can continue this cycle until the right meal appears, and the would be able to then copy the ingredients needed to replicate the meal, and prepare the meal for themselves!

The two buttons on the right end of the navbar are labeled, "Log In" and "Sign Up."
These buttons will take the user to the Log In/Sign Up page depending on which one the user chooses.

'Sign Up' will require the user to create a username and password that will be used to register the user's account.
Once the user has created the account, successfully meeting proper requirements, the user will be redirected to the 'Log In' page, where the user would be prompted to re-enter their information in order to complete the log in process.

Clicking the 'Log In' button will directly take the user to the log in form.
