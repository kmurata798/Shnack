# shnack

I will create an app that gives users the ability to click a button and generate a meal that they can choose to eat
for breakfast/lunch/dinner. The app would be useful for those who have a hard time deciding on what they want to eat
for a given day at a given time. Whether its someones lunch break or a bigger group meal, the users can specify what
kind of meals they would like. 

When in doubt, go with a SHNACK!
